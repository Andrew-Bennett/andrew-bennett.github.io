description: Moving Jekyll and adding posts

TL;DR - Moved from externally hosted blog, using new Jekyll theme with support for posts, which can be found [here][1]

After 2 years, this site finally gets an update and well... it all looks the same.

Originally this site was built using the grayscale Bootstrap theme created by [Start Bootstrap][2], which at first was fine, but presented the problem of having to externally host a blog somewhere else tumblr, Medium, Wordpress etc. So after a good look around I found an updated grayscale theme for Jekyll created by [jeromelachaud][3], which has been great to work with so far. However it seemed to be missing a few key features for me, mainly support for posts & Google Analytics. Since I couldn't find anything to fit my needs, I had to do the next best thing - build it for myself, which I did! 

So for anyone looking for a grayscale theme in Jekyll, with support for posts & analytics you can find just that [here][1]
